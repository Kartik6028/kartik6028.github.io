						<h3>The Problem Statement and Research</h3>
						<p>
							In Continuation of the previous week's time capsule assignment, we were given the task to design the actual physical time capsule that we would like to use.
							</p>
							<ol>
							<p>
							I divided this design assignment into two categories: Basic requirements and Aesthetics.
							Basic requirements covers the materials and shape to be used that can be sustained for atleast 100 years. After reading multiple articles on time capsules i realised that most of these are opened after a 100-150 years, provided they are found in proper condition. My first goal was to make sure that this capsule can actually survive the 100 years of toil underground. After some research i found out that 100 years can damage a lot. In addition there are many other factors that can accelerate the decomposition. </p>
								<li>
							 Water Damage :- This is by far the most deadly natural element that reacts with almost all metals and results in slow corrosion due to creation of iron oxide. Persistent water flow can also hammer permanant loss and change in shape of the material. So for this time capsule we need a material that is non corrosive, and can handle persistent pressure over long periods of time.
							My first choice was stainless steel or aluminium. Due to weight and cost of stainless steel i chose to go with aluminium.
								</li>

							<li>
							Metal reacts with soil :- Due to presence of ions, minerals and electrolytic nature of soil, simply using a corrosion free metal like aluminium would not suffice.Abrasion, some salts will break through that skin and progressively eat through the metal. Aluminium while very durable and non corrosive cannot be used for atleast the outer skin of the time capsule.
							</li>

							<li>

							There is another issue, even with non corrosive metal like stainless steel, if left for long periods of time they can weld together.After much deliberation i decided upon HIGH Fire Ceramics to be the outer sheath of the time capsule.</li>
							<li>
							I read in an article that even nuclear waste sites in the US and Europe, the Global Seed Vault, and the Mormon Genealogical Archive â€“ all are fighting a losing battle to keep water out. Over centuries and millennia, water will always find a way in. The only successful mitigations of water are when it is redirected rather than blocked. The ancient rice paddies of Asia are a testament to the effectiveness of carefully directing water over thousands of years.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Finally i think in order to address all of the above mentioned concerns, i finalized upon the following design :-
							A cylinderical aluminium container with an aluminium lid that has rubber gaskets to keep everything waterproof. This container will be sheathed in another bigger ceramic cyllindrical container that has threads on the outer surface to direct any water along the edges of the container and away from it.
							</p>

							<h2>Prototyping and CAD Designs</h2>

								<h3>Sketching out ideas</h3>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/tc6.jpg" width=90% lt="" /></center></span>
								<p>
									My first idea was to make an actual digital timer that starts from 00:00:00 and goes uptil the capsule is opened. While this idea was very cool and dramatic, it is very hard to design circuits, especially timer circuts that can power themselves adn last that long without decomposing. </p>
									<p>
									Next I settled on a cylinderical shape that can easily be built and can employ some water redirection techniques using threads much like a screw. </p>

								<h3>Designing CAD</h3>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/tc2.png" width=80% lt="" /></center></span>

								<p> The internal aluminium container design is really simple just a straight up cylindrical shape with a rubber gasketted lid on top. I also decided to engrave the date at which this capsule will be burried (couldn't let go of the clock idea entirely). </p>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/tc4.png" width=80% lt="" /></center></span>


								<p>
									I designed the outer sheath also in a cylinderical shape but with thread like grooves inorder to redirect any impacting water. This outer layer will be made out of ceramic.
								</p>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/tc3.png" width=80% lt="" /></center></span>

								<p>
									I plan to 3D print a miniature version of the outer cylinder and use a premade aluminium cylinder for the inner capsule. I also wish to use Laser engraving on the internal tumbler to engrave a date.
									</p>

								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p> During the research for this assignment i came across many interesting articles that discussed about how to choose materials that can last for 1000s of years. In my quest i also came across predictions for the environmental changes that can possibly occur in the next 100 years. For example some scientists believe that the water level could rise upto 2 meters in the next 100 years which would result in an underwater city !
