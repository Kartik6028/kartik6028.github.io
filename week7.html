						<h3>The Idea</h3>
						<p>When i first read about this assignment i thought it would be a challenge as i have never been someone who beleives in posessions. I cherish memories. That got me thinking is there anything that i have in the physical world that could capture or atleast denote the importance of those memories ? The answer came instantly to me - Photos ! When i dug deep i found out that even though i beleived myself to be a non sentimental person, i still have saved some of the items that my friends/family have gifted my over the years. These items along with some of the photos that i cherish shall go in my time capsule !

								<h3>Item 1 - The Photos</h3>
								<p> I think one of the best things that came out of this era are the ease of capturing and storing photographs. While searching for some of them for this assignment i came across so many unexpected pictures that i have totally forgotten about in my photo cloud. These photos date back to 2014, when i got my first smartphone ! i don't even remember taking half of them, but google has it all.
								while this is a little creepy, the joy that i felt after looking at these pictures was overwhelming. Another thing that i am very fascinated about in the present technology is encryptions ! you can scramble something completely so much so that it can never be retrieved unless you have the right "key" . So i decided to combine these two technologies and create a collage of all my cherished photos and encrypt it using a random algorithm.As an engineer it is my hope that in 100 years encryption tech would've have advanced enough to crack my collage back to it's original form.

								<h3>Item 2 - MY NYU ID</h3>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/t3.jpg" width=50% lt="" /></center></span>
								<p>As an international immigrant it was always a dream to travel to the United States and make a living. That dream came true after a lot of struggle when i got a chance to come study at NYU in 2021. Despite of uncertainity and fear due to the pandemic, i pushed myself to pursue my dreams and have not regretted that decision one bit.The thought of leaving your home to go and live in a foreign country, managing everything by yourself was exciting but also fearful. I am happy that i took this step as it not only gave me a great oppurtunity to study in the states, being exposed to all the cool labs and resources but also taught me some essential life skills. Living in New York, cooking for myself, handling expenses, learning to drive, all these skills were a gift that came along with NYU.
									Naturally my NYU ID, my gateway to all this has to be in my time capsule.

								<h3>Item 3 - A 10 Rupee note</h3>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/t4.jpg" width=50% lt="" /></center></span>

								<p> Back in my undergrad, there was a time when i was struggling with my some personal insecurities.Not unlike many college students i was constantly worried about my public image and whether people even like me or not.My struggle came to a halt, when on my 18th birthday, all my childhood and college friends came together outside my college to surprise me. I will never forget this moment, because that was the day i realised that people who truly love me and know me would never judge me based on my outer appearance.This gave me the confidence in life to do whatever i felt was right for me instead of trying to get people to like me.

									As a birthday gift, they all gave me a 10 rupee note (indian currency) with a small frivoulous and personal note on it that i cherish till today.In all honesty i accidentally found this nore yesterday when it flung out of a deep forgotten wallet pocket(Coincidence ? I THINK NOT)I knew this had to be in my time capsule.

								<h3>Item 4 - My first Penny !</h3>
								<span class="image featured"><center><img src="images/t5.jpg" width=50% lt="" /></center></span>


								<p> The first penny i ever earned on my own.I think that moment will always be close to my heart when after much effort i got my first salary and took my parents out for dinner.It's not exactly the same penny but its a symbol of self confidence and always gives me a sense of achievement whenever i am down. 
							</p>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Conclusion</h3>
								<p> This was a beautiful assignment that reminded me of all the great memories i have had over the years.Always focusing on the next thing, i never realised how far i have come.I hope then when/if this time capsule is opened after many years these items can emote the same value as they do for me today.
