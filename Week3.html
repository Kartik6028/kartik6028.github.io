						<h3>ANIMAL RESEARCH</h3>
						<p>As we go into the third week of Ideation and prototyping class, we are posed with a rather interesting prospect of combining something waste and upcycling it to represent an endangered animal. I decided to first choose an animal, a BLUE WHALE !, and then start collecting waste materials, with a mental image of the framework of how that animal can be represented.In the following paragraphs i have posted my research on this majestic animal.</p>
						<p> So, let me first address the elephant in the room, or rather 33 elephants in the room because that's how much it actually weighs! Reaching a maximum of 98 ft and 199 tones of weight, it is the largest animal known that has EVER existed.
							</p>
							<p>Relatively, and funnily enough it has a “slender” body and kind of lighter on the underside. There are roughly four subspecies that are found in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, Indian Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean. There is also a population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.									Considering their favorite meal is euphausiids (krill), their stomach can hold up to one ton of krill and it needs to eat about four tons of krill each day. They are generally solitary or gather in small groups and have no well-defined social structure other than mother-calf bonds. The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25 Hz at 188 decibels, which makes them the loudest animals on the planet. They are even louder than a jet engine which reaches about 140 decibels. Their low-frequency whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles and is probably used to attract other blue whales.</p>
									<p>
									The blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th century. It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as endangered as of 2018. It continues to face numerous threats, both man-made (ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise, and climate change) and natural (killer whale predation).

								<h3>Building IT !</h3>
								<h4>1) Sketching/Planning</h4>

								<p >The animal that I chose is the majestic blue whale! The first thing I did was to get some reference images off the internet so that I can have a mental framework of what its body would look like.I decided to use my recently learned skills (photoshop) to annotate over the existing images to form basic shapes that i can model using the materials i found.</p>
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/whales_anottated.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						
						
							
								<h4> 2)Gathering Materials</h4>

								<p>As I spend most of my time in the makerspace, around hardware/metal objects, most of the material that I was able to gather was related to that. Shown below is an image of all the possible things I could find.</p>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Waste material.png" alt="" /></span>
						

							
								<h4>3)Modeling the middle body and the tail</h4>

								<p>So right off the bat, I noticed that if I taped the dismantled Dremel parts in a certain way it could form the middle body of the whale.The other interesting observation was that I could possibly adjust two plastic join pieces together to form almost a perfect tail!</p>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/lowerbody.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h4>4) Dorsal fins and the "BRIDGE"</h4>

								<p>Next part was particularly tricky, as I needed to get that perfect curved kind of bridge portion to merge into the tail fins. After trying various iterations I landed on these two pieces of metal one of which I bent using a tablewise and attached to the body in a way that it somewhat resembled the “bridge portion”.
									 I also found this spare hinge, which I used to make a small dorsal fin.
									AfterI used some spare, damaged surgical masks to fashion a side fin for either side
									</p>

								<h4>5)The JAW</h4>

								<p>After this all that was required was to build the jaw portion. This was particularly tricky as I couldn’t find any piece of material that could fit that triangular curvy shape. In the end, I decided to use this flexible piece of foam to cut out two pieces, which were joined with a piece of metal in between them forming the upper and lower jaw.</p>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/jaw.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h4>6)Final Design</h4>

								<p>After about half a roll of masking tape and lots of glue, this was the final design.</p>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/Final.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<h4>7) Final Thoughts</h4>

								<p> I find some poetic justice in using some “heavy” materials which are in general very hard to recycle, to build/represent a model of such a gigantic animal.</p>
